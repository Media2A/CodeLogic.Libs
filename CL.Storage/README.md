Provider-neutral, root-scoped storage for CodeLogic 4 and .NET 10. One API mounts local/UNC,
S3-compatible, FTP/FTPS, SFTP, WebDAV, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage, and OpenStack Swift
connections, and adds what a desktop file-transfer client needs on top: verified and resumable
transfers between any two connections, a durable background queue, three-way sync with approved plans,
change watching, and connection diagnostics.

This README is an overview. The full guide is on the documentation site:

## Install and load

```bash
dotnet add package CodeLogic.Storage
```

```csharp
using CL.Storage;
using CodeLogic;

var init = await CodeLogic.CodeLogic.InitializeAsync();
if (init.ShouldExit) return;
await Libraries.LoadAsync<StorageLibrary>();
await CodeLogic.CodeLogic.ConfigureAsync();   // the class CodeLogic.CodeLogic, not the namespace
await CodeLogic.CodeLogic.StartAsync();

var storage = Libraries.Get<StorageLibrary>();
IStorageService media = storage.GetStorage("media");
```

`storage` (the `StorageLibrary`) owns connections, cross-connection transfers, the queue, sync, and
diagnostics; an `IStorageService` is one connection's file operations. Every connection mounts exactly one
local root, bucket or container prefix, or remote directory. Paths are relative, slash-separated paths
below that mount: a leading `/` is ignored, and `..` segments (or a local path that resolves outside the
root) fail with `storage.invalid_path`.

Applications that manage connections themselves can skip configuration files entirely with
`new StorageLibrary(new StorageLibraryOptions { RuntimeOnly = true })` and
`AddOrUpdateConnectionAsync`.

## Providers and configuration

Provider connections live in typed, case-insensitive `Connections` dictionaries, one configuration
section per provider. Connection IDs must be unique across all sections.

| Section | Connection model | Mounted resource |
|---|---|---|
| `storage.local` | `LocalConnectionConfig` | local directory or UNC share |
| `storage.s3` | `S3ConnectionConfig` | bucket plus optional prefix |
| `storage.ftp` | `FtpConnectionConfig` | FTP/FTPS directory |
| `storage.sftp` | `SftpConnectionConfig` | SFTP directory |
| `storage.webdav` | `WebDavConnectionConfig` | WebDAV endpoint plus root |
| `storage.azure` | `AzureBlobConnectionConfig` | Blob container plus prefix |
| `storage.gcs` | `GoogleCloudConnectionConfig` | GCS bucket plus prefix |
| `storage.swift` | `SwiftConnectionConfig` | Swift container plus prefix |

The `storage` section holds the master switch, `DefaultConnection`, the buffered-download limit, the
health-check timeout, and library-wide speed limits. Example `config.storage.s3.json`:

```json
{
  "Connections": {
    "media": {
      "Enabled": true,
      "Bucket": "company-media",
      "Prefix": "production",
      "Region": "eu-north-1",
      "AuthenticationMode": "DefaultCredentialChain"
    },
    "minio": {
      "Enabled": true,
      "Bucket": "documents",
      "ServiceUrl": "https://minio.example.com",
      "ForcePathStyle": true,
      "AuthenticationMode": "StaticCredentials",
      "AccessKey": "...",
      "SecretKey": "..."
    }
  }
}
```

Security is on by default: clear-text custom endpoints need `AllowInsecureHttp`, SFTP needs a trusted host
key (fingerprints or `known_hosts`; `AutoAcceptHostKey` is for development only), FTPS and WebDAV validate
certificates and accept certificate or public-key pins but have no accept-any switch, and raw FTP/SSH
commands need `AllowRawCommands`. FTP and SFTP keep pooled sessions, shared by registrations with identical
settings; FTP, SFTP, and WebDAV retry transient failures. Every remote provider can use an HTTP, SOCKS5, or
SOCKS4 proxy. See [Connections](https://zyntal-com.github.io/CodeLogic.Libs/libs/storage/connections.html).

## Everyday operations

```csharp
await using var source = File.OpenRead("photo.jpg");
Result<StorageItem> uploaded = await media.UploadAsync(
    "photos/photo.jpg",
    source,
    new StorageUploadOptions
    {
        Overwrite = false,
        ContentType = "image/jpeg",
        Metadata = new Dictionary<string, string> { ["owner"] = "42" }
    });

Result<StoragePage> page = await media.ListAsync("photos", new StorageListOptions
{
    Recursive = true,
    PageSize = 250
});

Result<byte[]> range = await media.DownloadBytesAsync(
    "photos/photo.jpg",
    new StorageDownloadOptions { Offset = 1024, Length = 4096 });

Result deleted = await media.DeleteAsync(
    "photos",
    new StorageDeleteOptions { Recursive = true });
```

The common contract covers info and exists, paged (and recursive) listings, directories, streaming and
bounded byte uploads and downloads, ranges, delete, copy, move, and cancellation. `EnumeratePagesAsync` and
`EnumerateItemsAsync` walk continuation tokens lazily, and batch helpers run bounded, order-preserving
info, delete, copy, and move. `StorageServiceExtensions` adds file, text, JSON, progress, and checksum
helpers. Caller upload streams stay open; a returned download stream owns its provider response and must
be disposed.

Capabilities are granular flags plus provider limits; check them rather than inferring behavior from a
provider name. Optional features (metadata, tags, versions, signed URLs, permissions, links, raw commands,
free space) return `storage.unsupported` where a connection lacks them:

```csharp
if (media.Capabilities.Supports(StorageFeature.MetadataWrite))
    await media.SetMetadataAsync("photo.jpg", new Dictionary<string, string> { ["reviewed"] = "yes" });
```

## Transfers

`StorageLibrary.CopyAsync` and `MoveAsync` copy or move a file or a whole tree between any two
connections, through a bounded relay into a staging object that is promoted only when complete. They
return a `StorageTransferReport` rather than throwing: `Completed`, `Skipped`, `Failed` (nothing
committed), `NeedsReconciliation` (a mixed state), or `Cancelled`, plus exactly what was left behind and a
`ResumeToken` when the transfer can continue.

```csharp
StorageTransferReport report = await storage.CopyAsync("sftp", "in/report.pdf", "s3", "archive/report.pdf", new StorageTransferOptions
{
    DestinationCondition = new StorageMutationCondition { ExpectedETag = seenDestination.ETag }, // replace only this version
    ExpectedSourceETag = plannedSource.ETag,        // or SourceVersionId, to read an exact version
    ExpectedSourceLength = plannedSource.Size,
    Verify = true                                   // SHA-256 during the copy, destination confirmed
});
Console.WriteLine($"{report.Outcome}: {report.WrittenPath} ({report.ConditionEnforcement}, verified by {report.VerifiedBy})");
```

- A single file's committed destination is never rolled back; what went wrong afterwards is reported.
  A move deletes its source only while it is still the version that was copied.
- `ConditionEnforcement` says whether the destination condition was enforced by the server in the
  committing request (`Atomic`) or checked just before it (`CheckedBeforeCommit`);
  `GetConditionEnforcementAsync` asks a connection in advance.
- `ConflictPolicy` mirrors FileZilla's "target exists" choices (`Skip`, `OverwriteIfNewer`, `Rename`, …) and
  `Resume` continues staged bytes of the same source, across processes with a resume token.
- `OpenWriteAsync` returns a `StorageWriteStream` for push-style producers, committed with `CommitAsync`.
- Progress reports carry speed and time remaining; speed limits apply per connection and library-wide.

See [Transfers & Sync](https://zyntal-com.github.io/CodeLogic.Libs/libs/storage/transfers.html) for the
per-provider guarantees, resume rules, and streamed writes.

## Transfer queue

`OpenTransferQueueAsync` runs transfers in the background, like FileZilla's queue, with global and
per-connection limits, priorities, pause and resume, and automatic retries of transient failures:

```csharp
var opened = await storage.OpenTransferQueueAsync(new StorageTransferQueueOptions
{
    MaxConcurrentTransfers = 4,
    MaxTransfersPerConnection = 2,
    Store = myDurableStore          // optional: jobs survive restarts and can be shared between processes
});
await using var queue = opened.Value!;
queue.ProgressChanged += job => Console.WriteLine($"{job.Destination}: {job.Progress?.BytesTransferred:N0} B");

await queue.EnqueueCopyAsync("s3", "reports/q3.pdf", "sftp", "outbox/q3.pdf",
    new StorageTransferOptions { Verify = true, ConflictPolicy = StorageConflictPolicy.Resume },
    priority: 10, jobId: "q3-report");   // same id + same work = same job
await queue.WaitForIdleAsync();
```

Jobs are data (`StorageTransferJobSpec`) kept in an `IStorageTransferJobStore`. Revisions and leases with
fencing tokens keep two processes from running one job; after a restart a job goes back to the queue when
its destination was never touched, and otherwise waits as `Interrupted` for a person. Trust and credential
failures block a job, and a mixed state marks it `NeedsReconciliation`.

## Compare and sync

```csharp
var options = new StorageSyncOptions
{
    Direction = StorageSyncDirection.TwoWay,
    StateStore = baselines, SyncId = "site",          // a baseline makes two-way three-way
    MaxDeletes = 100, MaxDeletePercent = 10,
    Compare = new StorageCompareOptions { Exclude = ["**/*.tmp", "cache/**"] }
};
var plan = (await storage.PlanSyncAsync("sftp", "site", "s3", "backup/site", options)).Value!;
// show plan.Actions, plan.Conflicts, and plan.Warnings; approve plan.Digest
var synced = await storage.ApplySyncAsync("sftp", "site", "s3", "backup/site", plan, approvedDigest, options);
```

`CompareAsync` diffs two trees by size and time or by checksum. Sync runs `Update`, `Mirror`, or `TwoWay`;
with a baseline, two-way is a three-way sync that carries edits and deletions to the other side and
reports changes on both sides as conflicts (`Block`, `KeepBoth`, or `NewerWins`). A plan is approved by its
digest and applied only as planned: each step re-checks its items, deletions are withheld when they exceed
the limits or a side looks unexpectedly empty, and folders are never deleted recursively.

## Watching for changes

```csharp
await foreach (var change in media.WatchAsync("incoming", cancellationToken: stopping))
    Console.WriteLine($"{change.Kind}: {change.Path}");
```

Local connections use native notifications; other providers are polled (optionally incrementally).

## Connections at runtime

```csharp
await storage.AddOrUpdateConnectionAsync("backup", new SftpConnectionConfig
{
    Host = "sftp.example.com",
    Username = "backup",
    AuthenticationMode = SftpAuthenticationMode.PrivateKey,
    PrivateKeyPath = @"C:\keys\backup_ed25519",
    HostKeyFingerprints = ["SHA256:..."]
}, persist: false);
```

`TestConnectionAsync` tries settings before they are saved and reports the certificate or host key a
server presented, ready to pin; `GetConnectionDiagnosticsAsync` describes a live connection (negotiated
TLS or SSH algorithms, server software and features, session pool counters). Native SDK clients remain
available through `GetNativeClient` and `OpenNativeConnectionAsync`.

## Errors and events

Expected failures come back as a failed `Result` with a stable `storage.*` code, such as
`storage.not_found`, `storage.conflict`, `storage.authentication_failed`, `storage.tls_failure` (with a
`tlsReason`), or `storage.unsupported`; `StorageErrorInfo.IsTransient` says whether retrying may help.
Connection calls throw `OperationCanceledException` on a cancel, while `StorageLibrary.CopyAsync`/`MoveAsync`,
the queue, and a sync that has started applying report it. Writes, deletes, transfers, health changes,
session events, failed operations, and queue job changes are published on the CodeLogic event bus. See
[Errors & Events](https://zyntal-com.github.io/CodeLogic.Libs/libs/storage/errors-events.html).
