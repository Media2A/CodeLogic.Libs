namespace CL.Storage.Queue;

/// <summary>
/// Where a <see cref="StorageTransferQueue"/> keeps its jobs, so they survive a restart and can be shared
/// between processes. Implement it over a database to make the queue durable; the default keeps jobs in memory.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>Each method must be atomic for its job. Three rules keep concurrent queues from overwriting each other:</para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><b>Revisions.</b> Every stored record has a <see cref="StorageTransferJobRecord.Revision"/>.
/// <see cref="AddAsync"/> stores revision 1 for an id never stored before, and every successful
/// <see cref="SaveAsync"/> stores the next one. A save or remove whose record does not carry the current revision
/// is refused: the caller worked from a stale copy. Claims, renewals, and releases do not change the revision.
/// Like fencing tokens, revisions do not restart when an id is removed and added again: the new record starts
/// above every revision the id had before, so a copy from its earlier life can neither save over nor remove
/// it. A store keeps the highest revision (and fencing token) per removed id for that.</item>
/// <item><b>Leases.</b> The store owns <see cref="StorageTransferJobRecord.LeaseOwner"/>,
/// <see cref="StorageTransferJobRecord.LeaseExpiresAt"/>, and <see cref="StorageTransferJobRecord.FencingToken"/>;
/// the values in a record passed to <see cref="SaveAsync"/> are ignored. <see cref="TryClaimAsync"/> succeeds
/// only for the expected revision and when no other worker holds an unexpired lease (the same worker may claim
/// again, which a restarted process needs). A save or remove with a lease succeeds only while that lease is
/// current (same owner and token, unexpired); one without a lease only while no worker holds an unexpired lease.</item>
/// <item><b>Fencing.</b> Every claim issues a fencing token greater than any issued before for that job id,
/// including tokens issued before the job was removed and added again, so a lease from an earlier life of the
/// id never matches a later one.</item>
/// </list>
/// <para><b>Whose clock decides.</b> The store's clock alone decides whether a lease has expired: claims, saves,
/// renewals, and removes compare <see cref="StorageTransferJobRecord.LeaseExpiresAt"/> with the store's time
/// (a database should use its own <c>now()</c>, not the caller's). The queue reads the same field with its own
/// clock only as a hint, to decide when to try a claim again and when a renewal is overdue; a skewed worker
/// clock therefore costs a refused claim or an early stop, never two workers holding one job.</para>
/// <para><b>Schema.</b> Records carry a <see cref="StorageTransferJobRecord.SchemaVersion"/> and their spec a
/// <see cref="StorageTransferJobSpec.SchemaVersion"/>; a store that serializes them must keep both (or use
/// <see cref="StorageTransferJobRecord.ToJson"/>). A queue leaves records written by a newer schema alone. A
/// store that keeps records as JSON must skip a row it cannot read (<see cref="StorageTransferJobRecord.FromJson"/>
/// throws for a newer schema) in <see cref="LoadAsync"/> instead of failing the whole load, and may answer null
/// for it from <see cref="GetAsync"/>, which takes the job out of this queue's view without changing it.</para>
/// <para><b>Columns win.</b> A store that keeps the revision and the lease fields
/// (<see cref="StorageTransferJobRecord.Revision"/>, <see cref="StorageTransferJobRecord.LeaseOwner"/>,
/// <see cref="StorageTransferJobRecord.LeaseExpiresAt"/>, <see cref="StorageTransferJobRecord.FencingToken"/>) in
/// columns of their own, next to the record's JSON, must return the columns' values: the copies inside the JSON
/// are only as new as the last save, since claims, renewals, and releases change the columns alone.</para>
