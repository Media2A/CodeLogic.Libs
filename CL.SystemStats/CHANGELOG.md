# CL.SystemStats — Changelog

All notable changes to **CodeLogic.SystemStats** are documented here. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- `GetTopProcessesByCpuAsync` now measures real per-process CPU usage by
  sampling each process's processor time over an interval, instead of sorting by
  a value that was always 0 (which returned an arbitrary order). Sampling uses
  the configured `CpuSamplingIntervalMs`.

### Documentation

- Full rewrite of the README and the system-stats guide to the shared house
  style: concise NuGet-friendly README (badges, tagline, install, quick start,
  features, configuration table, docs link, requirements) and a single deep docs
  page at `docs/libs/systemstats.md`.
- Documented the cross-platform provider split (Windows registry / PerformanceCounter /
  `GlobalMemoryStatusEx` / `TickCount64` vs. Linux `/proc`), with the unknown-platform
  fall back to the Linux provider.
- Covered every method as `Task<Result<T>>` and the `SystemStatsLibrary` forwarding
  surface alongside the `Stats` service (`ClearCache`, `GetPlatformInfo`, `IsInitialized`).
- Clarified that per-process `CpuUsagePercent` is `0.0` on both platforms
  (point-in-time, not sampled), that `HandleCount` is the fd count on Linux, and
  that `CachedBytes` / `BuffersBytes` are `0` on Windows.
- Documented which calls are cached vs. uncached, the published events and which
  methods trigger threshold checks, the validated `config.systemstats.json`
  fields with ranges, and the health-check states.

## [4.5.1] — 2026-06-20

### Documentation

- Rewrote the system-monitoring guide and refreshed the README to match the
  current API: `Result<T>`-returning methods, static info accessors
  (`GetCpuInfoAsync` / `GetMemoryInfoAsync`), `GetSystemUptimeAsync`,
  `GetAllProcessesAsync`, and the `CpuInfo` / `CpuStats` / `MemoryInfo` /
  `MemoryStats` / `ProcessStats` / `SystemSnapshot` record shapes (including
  MiB/GiB helper properties).
- Documented the published events (`SystemSnapshotTakenEvent`,
  `HighCpuUsageEvent`, `HighMemoryUsageEvent`) and which calls trigger threshold
  checks.
- Documented result caching behavior, the cached vs. uncached calls, and
  `ClearCache()` via the `Stats` property.
- Corrected the configuration reference to the real `config.systemstats.json`
  fields and value ranges.

## [4.5.0] — 2026-05-24

### Changed

- **Unified versioning.** All CodeLogic.Libs now share a single version line
  controlled by `version.txt` in the repo root. This is a version alignment
  release — no functional changes to this library.
## [4.0.4] — 2026-04-16

### Changed

- README + manifest refresh for the v4 baseline. No functional changes vs 4.0.3.
- `LibraryManifest.Version` now reads from assembly metadata.

## [4.0.2] — 2026-04-09

### Changed

- Annotated SystemStats configuration with `[ConfigField]` for the admin UI surface.
- Aligned with the v4 baseline across all libraries.

### Fixed

- Removed the Windows-only condition on transitive dependencies so the
  library actually loads on Linux containers.

## [4.0.0] — 2026-04-09

Major rewrite. Republished as v4.0.0 to reset the version line under the
unified v4 baseline. Cross-platform CPU / memory / disk / network sampling
backed by Windows performance counters and Linux `/proc`.

### Notes

- Earlier history is retained in the
  [git log](https://github.com/Media2A/CodeLogic.Libs/commits/main/CL.SystemStats).
