# CL.Storage

> Safe mounted storage across local filesystems, S3, FTP/FTPS, SFTP, WebDAV, Azure Blob,
> Google Cloud Storage, and OpenStack Swift — with the connection options, transfer features, and
> diagnostics of a desktop file-transfer client.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Package** | [`CodeLogic.Storage`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CodeLogic.Storage) |
| **Library class** | `CL.Storage.StorageLibrary` |
| **Config files** | `config.storage.json` · `config.storage.<provider>.json` |
| **Target** | .NET 10 / CodeLogic 4 |
| **Result model** | `Result` and `Result<T>`; connection calls throw `OperationCanceledException` on cancel, while `StorageLibrary.CopyAsync`/`MoveAsync` and an applying sync report it |

This overview covers loading, the mount model, configuration, and the everyday API. The rest lives on
four sub-pages:

- **[Connections](connections.md)** — SFTP authentication, host keys, and jump hosts; FTP/FTPS and
  WebDAV options; proxies; session pools shared across registrations, retries, and keep-alive; runtime
  connections and runtime-only mode; testing settings and diagnosing a live connection.
- **[Transfers & Sync](transfers.md)** — safe copies and moves with transfer reports, guaranteed and
  verified transfers, streamed writes, conflict policies, staged resume and append, progress and speed
  limits, the durable transfer queue, compare and three-way sync with approved plans, watching for
  changes, and links in transfers.
- **[Files & Attributes](files.md)** — permissions, ownership, timestamps, links, server-side
  checksums, metadata/tags/versions/signed URLs, raw commands, and free space.
- **[Errors & Events](errors-events.md)** — the `storage.*` error codes, transient-failure helpers,
  and every event the library publishes.

## Install and start

```bash
dotnet add package CodeLogic.Storage
```

```csharp
using CL.Storage;
using CodeLogic;

var init = await CodeLogic.CodeLogic.InitializeAsync();
if (init.ShouldExit) return;
await Libraries.LoadAsync<StorageLibrary>();
await CodeLogic.CodeLogic.ConfigureAsync();   // the class CodeLogic.CodeLogic, not the namespace
await CodeLogic.CodeLogic.StartAsync();

var storage = Libraries.Get<StorageLibrary>();
IStorageService files = storage.DefaultStorage;
IStorageService archive = storage.GetStorage("archive");
```

Throughout these pages `storage` is the `StorageLibrary` (connections, cross-connection transfers,
diagnostics) and `files` is one connection's `IStorageService` (file operations on that mount).

`GetStorage` returns a stable proxy. Replacing a connection does not invalidate the proxy, and the
old backend stays alive until active operations and returned download/native-session leases drain.

## Mount model and paths

Each connection mounts one security boundary:

- a local directory or UNC root;
- an S3/GCS bucket and optional prefix;
- an Azure/Swift container and optional prefix;
- an FTP, SFTP, or WebDAV directory.

API paths are relative to that mount. Backslashes are normalized to `/`, empty and `.` segments are
removed (so a leading `/` is ignored), and a `..` segment or a NUL fails with `storage.invalid_path`, as
does a local path that resolves outside the root (a drive-qualified path, or a link leading out). The
empty path means the mounted root for info/listing and idempotent root directory creation; transfers need
a non-root path. Link targets, raw-command
paths, and every other path the library resolves stay inside the mount; only raw commands (off by
default) can reach outside it.

## Configuration

The main `storage` section contains the master enable switch, default connection ID, bounded byte
download limit, health-check settings, and library-wide speed limits. Providers register these
sections:

| Section | Model | Important settings |
|---|---|---|
| `storage.local` | `LocalConnectionConfig` | `RootPath`, `FollowLinks` |
| `storage.s3` | `S3ConnectionConfig` | `Bucket`, `Prefix`, `Region`, endpoint/auth, multipart bounds |
| `storage.ftp` | `FtpConnectionConfig` | host/root/auth, encryption/data mode, TLS pins and versions, encoding, listing parser |
| `storage.sftp` | `SftpConnectionConfig` | host/root, auth methods and keys, host-key pins or `known_hosts`, algorithms, jump host |
| `storage.webdav` | `WebDavConnectionConfig` | endpoint/root, Basic/Digest/NTLM/Negotiate/bearer auth, TLS pins, client certificate |
| `storage.azure` | `AzureBlobConnectionConfig` | container URI/prefix and credential mode |
| `storage.gcs` | `GoogleCloudConnectionConfig` | bucket/prefix, project/credential, upload chunk size, emulator URL |
| `storage.swift` | `SwiftConnectionConfig` | auth URL (Keystone or TempAuth), region, account/container/prefix |

Every section contains a case-insensitive `Connections` dictionary. IDs are globally unique, even
when the connections use different providers. Every remote connection accepts `Proxy` and
`TransferLimits`; FTP, SFTP, and WebDAV add `Retry`, and FTP and SFTP add `Session`. See
[Connections](connections.md).

### Security defaults

- S3, WebDAV, GCS, and Swift custom endpoints require HTTPS unless `AllowInsecureHttp` is enabled; an
  Azure `ServiceUri` must be HTTPS (Azurite works through a connection string).
- S3, WebDAV, and GCS endpoint URLs with user info, a query string, or a fragment are rejected, so secrets
  do not end up in configuration URLs.
- WebDAV custom headers cannot replace authorization/host/framing headers or contain line breaks.
- FTPS and WebDAV validate the certificate chain by default. Certificate (`TrustedCertificateSha256`)
  or public-key (`TrustedPublicKeySha256`) pins deliberately trust a specific server; there is no
  accept-any switch.
- SFTP needs a trusted host key: SHA-256 `HostKeyFingerprints`, an OpenSSH `KnownHostsPath`, or
  `AutoAcceptHostKey = true` for trusted development environments only.
- Raw FTP/SSH commands are disabled unless `AllowRawCommands` is set, because they are not confined
  to the mount.
- Diagnostics, events, and error details never contain credentials, provider bodies, or signed URLs.

## Everyday operations

```csharp
await using var input = File.OpenRead("asset.bin");
var put = await files.UploadAsync("assets/asset.bin", input, new StorageUploadOptions
{
    ConflictPolicy = StorageConflictPolicy.OverwriteIfNewer,
    CreateParents = true,
    ContentType = "application/octet-stream"
});

var info = await files.GetInfoAsync("assets/asset.bin");
var exists = await files.ExistsAsync("assets/asset.bin");
var page = await files.ListAsync("assets", new StorageListOptions
{
    Recursive = true,
    PageSize = 500,
    NamePattern = "*.bin"
});

var download = await files.DownloadAsync("assets/asset.bin");
if (download.IsSuccess)
{
    await using var owned = download.Value!;
    await owned.CopyToAsync(output);
}
```

Upload streams are caller-owned and remain open. A successful `DownloadAsync` value owns its provider
response, session, and registry lease until disposed. `DownloadBytesAsync` is bounded by the global
limit or `StorageDownloadOptions.MaxBufferedBytes`.

Listings hide the library's own staging and backup items (`.cl-storage-*`, `.clstorage-*`); set
`IncludeInternal` to see them. `IncludeHidden = false` drops hidden items (dot-files, and items marked
hidden) together with what hidden folders hold (on object stores, whose listings come in pages, every
folder name between the listed folder and an item is tested, so `.git/b` stays hidden on a page that no
longer holds `.git` itself), and `NamePattern` filters names with `*` and `?`
wildcards (case-insensitive); it applies to names only, so a recursive listing drops folders that do not
match but still returns matching files inside them. Recursive listings on S3, Azure Blob, Google Cloud, and Swift include
folders that exist only as key prefixes; they are sorted page by page, and an inferred folder can appear
again on a later page, so build a tree by path.

`EnumeratePagesAsync` and `EnumerateItemsAsync` walk provider tokens lazily and fail safely if a
provider repeats a token. Batch helpers preserve input order, cap item count/concurrency, and retain
one result per item rather than stopping at the first expected provider failure.

`StorageServiceExtensions` adds `UploadFileAsync` and atomic `DownloadToFileAsync` (both with conflict
policies and resume), bounded `ReadTextAsync`/`WriteTextAsync` and `ReadJsonAsync<T>`/`WriteJsonAsync<T>`,
`UploadWithProgressAsync`/`DownloadWithProgressAsync`, and streaming checksums with MD5, SHA-256, SHA-384,
or SHA-512 (see [Files & Attributes](files.md#server-side-checksums)). The batch helpers are
`GetInfoBatchAsync`, `DeleteBatchAsync`, `CopyBatchAsync`, and `MoveBatchAsync`, bounded by
`StorageBatchOptions` (`MaxConcurrency` 4, `MaxItems` 10,000).

```csharp
var progress = new Progress<StorageTransferProgress>(value =>
    Console.WriteLine($"{value.BytesTransferred} bytes"));

await files.UploadWithProgressAsync("large.bin", input, progress);
var text = await files.ReadTextAsync("notes/today.txt");
```

## Capabilities

Capabilities are granular flags plus provider limits. Check them at runtime rather than inferring
behavior from a provider name:

```csharp
if (files.Capabilities.Supports(StorageFeature.Permissions))
    await files.SetPermissionsAsync("deploy.sh", "750");
```

Optional features return `storage.unsupported` on connections that lack them. Flags include
`MetadataWrite`, `Tags`, `Versioning`, `SignedReadUrls`, `SignedWriteUrls`, `Permissions`, `Ownership`, `SetTimestamps`,
`CreateLinks`, `ReadLinks`, `Checksums`, `Append`, `ResumableUpload`, `AtomicMove`, `RawCommands`,
`SpaceInfo`, `ChangeNotifications`, `ConditionalCreate`, `ConditionalUpdate`, `ConditionalDelete`, and
`CaseInsensitivePaths`. `Capabilities.Limits` (`StorageLimits`) adds what a provider reports: page size,
object and single-upload size, metadata size, tag count, and preferred part size. See the capability table
in [Files & Attributes](files.md#metadata-tags-versions-and-signed-urls).

A flag says what the provider can do; on S3-compatible servers, whether a conditional request is really
enforced also depends on the server (see `ConditionalRequests` in
[Connections](connections.md#cloud-emulators-and-compatible-services)); under `ConditionalRequests = Auto`
the conditional flags are provisional until the connection's probe has run. A transfer reports how its
condition was enforced in `ConditionEnforcement`, and `GetConditionEnforcementAsync` asks a connection
directly (see [Guaranteed transfers](transfers.md#guaranteed-transfers)).

## Migration

The legacy `CodeLogic.StorageS3` package accepted a bucket on every operation. `CodeLogic.Storage`
mounts a bucket/prefix per connection and uses relative paths. This release also renames several
error codes, adds `ConflictPolicy`, extends `StorageItem` and `StorageConnectionInfo`, returns
`StorageTransferReport` from copies and moves, replaces `CreateTransferQueue` with
`OpenTransferQueueAsync`, makes two-way sync without a baseline report conflicts, and shares FTP/SFTP
session pools between registrations with identical settings. See the
package [`MIGRATION.md`](https://github.com/zyntal-com/CodeLogic.Libs/blob/main/CL.Storage/MIGRATION.md)
for every mapping.
