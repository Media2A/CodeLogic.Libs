# CL.PostgreSQL — Changelog

All notable changes to **CodeLogic.PostgreSQL** are documented here. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 2026-09-13

### Changed

> **Read this before upgrading if you set `defaultSchema`.**

- **BREAKING — `defaultSchema` now moves your entities.** It used to be applied only as the
  Npgsql `SearchPath` on the connection string while every generated statement was qualified
  with the hard-coded constant `public`. Setting `"defaultSchema": "app"` therefore gave you
  a `search_path` of `app` while all DDL and DML targeted `public`. It now does what it says:
  an entity **without** `[Table(Schema = "…")]` is created in, and every statement for it
  qualified with, the configured schema. `[Table(Schema = "…")]` still wins where present,
  and the schema is created with `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS` on first sync.

  *Migration.* If you left `defaultSchema` at its default `public`, nothing changes. If you
  set it to anything else, your live tables are in `public` and the library will now look for
  them in the configured schema — it will create empty tables there on the next sync. Either
  set `defaultSchema` back to `public` (and pin per-entity schemas with
  `[Table(Schema = "…")]` if you want them elsewhere), or move the tables first:

  ```sql
  CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS app;
  ALTER TABLE public.users SET SCHEMA app;   -- per table
  ```

  Resolution is per connection, so two named connections may now map the same entity types
  into different schemas. `PostgreSQLLibrary.RestoreSchemaAsync` follows suit: its
  `schemaName` parameter defaults to `null`, meaning "the connection's configured schema",
  instead of the literal `public`.

- **BEHAVIOUR — `Repository<T>.CountAsync` now applies the soft-delete filter.** It emitted
  a bare `SELECT COUNT(*)` while `GetAllAsync` and `GetPagedAsync` in the same class filtered
  `IS NULL`, so the two contradicted each other on a `[SoftDelete]` entity. `CountAsync()`
  and `GetAllAsync().Count` now agree. If you were relying on it to report the physical row
  count, use `Query<T>().IncludeDeleted().CountAsync()`.

- **DEFAULT — `captureExplainOnSlowQuery` now defaults to `false`.** It was declared `true`
  but nothing read it, so no plan was ever captured. Now that the capture is implemented,
  defaulting it to `true` would have started running an `EXPLAIN` for every slow query on
  upgrade; the default was flipped so runtime behaviour is unchanged. Set it to `true` to
  opt in.

  *Caveat.* Changing the declared default only covers configs that never wrote the key. A
  `config.postgresql.json` persisted by an earlier version may already contain
  `"captureExplainOnSlowQuery": true` on disk — that value is now honoured, and such an
  install **will** start capturing plans on upgrade. Set it to `false` explicitly if that is
  not what you want. The same applies to `n1DetectorThreshold` if a persisted config carries
  a non-zero value.

- `CacheConfiguration.MaxMemoryMb` and `PostgreSqlDatabaseConfig.PreparedStatementCacheSize`
  are marked `[Obsolete]`. Neither is read: the in-process cache evicts by entry count
  (`MaxEntries`), and statement caching is Npgsql's, configured on the connection string via
  `Max Auto Prepare` / `Auto Prepare Min Usages`. Both still compile and round-trip.

### Added

- **Slow-query `EXPLAIN` capture.** With `captureExplainOnSlowQuery` on, a query that
  crosses `slowQueryThresholdMs` has `EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON) <sql>` run with the same bound
  parameters on a separate connection, and the plan attached to `SlowQueryEvent.ExplainJson`.
  Strictly best-effort: fetched off the query path, skipped entirely for a query inside a
  transaction scope, skipped for statements `EXPLAIN` cannot accept (DDL, utility commands,
  multi-statement batches) and for parameterized statements whose values were not captured,
  and any failure leaves the event publishing with a null payload.
- **N+1 detection.** With `n1DetectorThreshold` above 0, executions of the same normalized
  SQL template are counted per connection over a rolling one-second window, and
  `N1QueryDetectedEvent` is published once per window when the count reaches the threshold.
  `0` (the default) disables it at the cost of a single bool read per query; the bookkeeping
  is capped at 512 templates and pruned by age.
- **`WithCache()` with no arguments**, on both the query builder and a projected query, using
  `postgresql.cache.defaultTtlSeconds` (60). Purely additive — `WithCache(TimeSpan)` is
  unchanged.
- `BackupManager.CleanupOldBackupsAsync` and `GetLatestBackupFile` take a `connectionId` so
  they resolve the same backup directory the writes used.

### Fixed (configuration that was declared but never read)

- **`queryTimeoutMs` is applied** as the command timeout on the commands the library creates
  (rounded up to whole seconds; `0` = no timeout). The 30 000 ms default matches both
  `commandTimeout` and Npgsql's own 30-second default, so nothing changes unless you change it.
- **`maxBatchInsertSize` reaches the repository.** `GetRepository<T>()` passed
  `slowQueryThresholdMs` but not the batch size, so the constructor default of 500 always
  won whatever the config said. Now plumbed through in both overloads (the `connectionId`
  one and the `TransactionScope` one).
- **`defaultStringSize` drives type inference.** `TypeConverter.InferColumn` hard-coded 255;
  schema sync now threads the connection's configured value through. Same default, so no
  change unless you set it.
- **`cacheEnabledOverride` is honoured** — when non-null it wins over the cache section's
  `enabled` for that connection. `null` (the default) inherits as before.
- **`backupDirectory` is honoured** by `BackupManager`. `null` keeps `DataDirectory/backups`.
- **`maxInClauseValues` is reported.** A generated `IN` list wider than the ceiling logs a
  warning once per query build, naming the entity and the value count. It deliberately does
  **not** throw or chunk — that would break callers who exceed it today.
- **`postgresql.cache.defaultTtlSeconds` and `publishEvents` are read.** The former backs the
  new parameterless `WithCache()`; the latter gates `CacheHitEvent` / `CacheMissEvent`
  publication (still `true` by default, so unchanged).
- `sslCertificatePath` / `sslKeyPath` / `sslRootCertificatePath` map to Npgsql's
  `SslCertificate`, `SslKey` and `RootCertificate`. This was already wired; the XML and docs
  now say which option each one is, since the field names do not match one-for-one.

### Fixed (correctness)

- **Retention never ran.** `RetentionWorker` snapshotted the registered entity set with
  `.ToList()` at construction, and the worker is constructed during `OnStartAsync` — but
  entities only register through `SyncTableAsync` / `SyncSchemaAsync`, which every documented
  flow calls *after* `CodeLogic.StartAsync()`. `HasWork` was therefore always false, the loop
  never started, and `[RetainDays]` was dead in normal usage. The worker's entry list is now
  live: registration hands each entity to it as it happens and starts the loop (idempotently)
  on the first `[RetainDays]` entity. The 5-minute initial delay, 24-hour interval,
  `RunOnceAsync()` and clean disposal are unchanged.
- **`ProjectedQuery` and `JoinedQuery` dropped the caller's `CancellationToken`** when
  handing work to `ConnectionManager.ExecuteWithConnectionAsync`, so opening the connection
  and the transient-retry backoff around it ignored cancellation. Forwarded, matching
  `QueryBuilder` and `Repository`.
- **`WhereExists(...).Select(...).WithCache(...)` could serve stale cross-table results.**
  `ShouldCache` / `ShouldSmartCache` deliberately refuse to cache a subquery-filtered query —
  the cache stamps an entry with one table's version counter, so a mutation on the inner
  table cannot invalidate it — but `Select` forwarded the cache decoration into the projection
  without that guard, and `.WithCache` called on the projection afterwards re-armed it. The
  verdict now travels with the query into `Select` and `GroupBy`, and a `WithCache` /
  `SmartCache` call on such a projection is ignored and logged instead of silently caching.

### Documentation

- Corrected the `SqlFn` XML documentation for the date-part helpers, which still described
  MySQL's `DAYOFWEEK(d) - 1` adjustment. PostgreSQL's `EXTRACT(DOW …)` already matches .NET's
  numbering and no adjustment is applied.
- **Raw SQL never joins a `TransactionScope`.** `SqlQueryAsync`, `SqlScalarAsync` and
  `ExecuteSqlAsync` have no scope overload and always take their own pooled connection, so a
  call inside an `await using` scope commits independently and is not rolled back with it.
  The query-builder page now warns about this and points at `GetRepository<T>(tx)`,
  `Query<T>(tx)` and `IMigrationContext`.
- **`[RetainDays]` only runs for entities synced before `CodeLogic.StartAsync()`.** The
  retention worker is constructed at start-up from a snapshot of the registered entity
  types, and entities register through `SyncTableAsync` / `SyncSchemaAsync`. Syncing after
  `StartAsync()` — the order every quick-start shows — leaves the worker with nothing to do.
  The schema page now states the ordering requirement and the `RunOnceAsync` alternative.
- **`RegisterDatabase` does not exist.** The README and overview showed
  `pg.RegisterDatabase(id, config)` for adding a connection at runtime; the real call is
  `pg.ConnectionManager.RegisterConfiguration(config, id)` — config first, id second.
- **The typed join sample would not compile.** `Join<TRight, TKey, TResult>` takes a left
  key selector, a right key selector and a result selector; the sample passed a two-argument
  join *condition* instead. `WhereIn` was shown with a two-parameter outer selector for the
  same reason — it takes `u => u.Column`.
- **Offset paging on the query builder is `ToPagedListAsync(page, pageSize)`**, not
  `GetPagedAsync` (which is the repository's method).
- **`RollbackAsync` takes a `MigrationVersion`**, not a `toVersion` string; the migrations
  sample now shows `new MigrationVersion("1.3.0", 0)`. `pg.RestoreSchemaAsync(...)` is the
  library-level restore entry point, not `pg.RestoreTableSchemaAsync`.
- **`RegisterCachePool`'s third argument is `maxIdleFires` (an `int`), and its warm-up
  callback is a `Func<Task>`** — the caching sample passed a query lambda in the int slot.
  The default `maxIdleFires` is 10, not 3, and it retires an idle *entry* rather than
  stopping the pool's timer.
- **There is no `AnyAsync` terminal** on the query builder; `Any` exists only inside a
  grouped projection as `g.Any()`.
- **Date-part translations normalise to UTC.** The query-builder page now shows the real
  SQL — `EXTRACT(… FROM (x) AT TIME ZONE 'UTC')::int`, `((x) AT TIME ZONE 'UTC')::date`, and
  `ROUND(v::numeric, d)::double precision` for `SqlFn.Round`.
- **`IN` lists are never chunked.** Several pages claimed `Contains` chunked at
  `maxInClauseValues`; every value is emitted in one list and the setting is not consulted.
  Chunk large sets yourself.
- **`EXPLAIN` capture and the N+1 detector are not implemented.** `captureExplainOnSlowQuery`
  and `n1DetectorThreshold` are reserved: no call site runs `EXPLAIN`, so
  `SlowQueryEvent.ExplainJson` is always null, and `N1QueryDetectedEvent` is never published.
  The feature list, event table and performance page no longer advertise them as working.
- **Documented several configuration keys that nothing reads.** `maxBatchInsertSize`,
  `maxInClauseValues`, `defaultStringSize`, `queryTimeoutMs`, `preparedStatementCacheSize`,
  `backupDirectory`, `cacheEnabledOverride`, and the cache section's `defaultTtlSeconds` and
  `publishEvents` are now marked as not currently applied, naming the value actually in force.
- **`defaultSchema` does not move entities.** It is applied as the connection's
  `search_path`; an entity without `[Table(Schema = …)]` always maps to the literal `public`.
- **`GetCacheStats()` returns structure, not counters** — total entries, entries by table
  and table-version counters. It has never reported hits, misses or evictions.
  `GetCachePoolStats()` likewise reports interval, entry count and tick counts, not hit counts.
- **Transient retry also covers SQLSTATE `55P03`** (lock not available), alongside `40001`
  and `40P01`. The config field's XML still named MySQL's error numbers 1213 and 1205.
- **`UpsertWithIncrementsAsync` return value.** Its XML documented MySQL's
  "2 = update" affected-row convention; PostgreSQL counts an `ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE` row
  once, so the result is 1 whether the row was inserted or updated.
- Removed further MySQL leftovers from the XML comments: the config file was named
  `config.mysql.json` and the localization file `mysql.{culture}.json`; the column-reference
  builder claimed backtick quoting (PostgreSQL uses double quotes); the CRC, schema-state and
  sync comments said `information_schema` where the analyzer reads `pg_catalog`; the
  retention worker described a `DELETE … LIMIT` friendly to "InnoDB's undo log" rather than
  its actual `ctid` + `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` batching; and the query-builder samples called
  `mysql.Query<T>()`.
- `[Column(Charset = …)]` is documented as what it emits — a `COLLATE` clause — and
  `[Column(Unsigned = …)]` as inert, since PostgreSQL has no unsigned integer types.
- `IMigrationContext` offers `ExecuteAsync`, `QueryAsync<T>`, `ScalarAsync<T>` and
  `SyncTableAsync<T>` plus the raw connection and transaction; it has no `TableExistsAsync`
  and does not expose the analyzer.
- Retention's schedule is stated: a first pass five minutes after startup, then every 24 hours.
- Removed a duplicated `<summary>` block on the schema analyzer's column-diff check whose
  first copy still described MySQL facets (auto-increment, charset).
- Corrected the `connectionLifetime` XML (it is the pooled *idle* lifetime) and the
  `TypeConverter` example type strings (`character varying(255)`, not `VARCHAR(255)`).

### Fixed (found while completing PostgreSQL coverage)

- **A migration registered twice ran twice.** `Register` and `RegisterFrom` both appended
  unconditionally, so the documented pairing of `RegisterMigrationsFrom(assembly)` with an
  explicit `RegisterMigration(...)` held two copies of the same migration — and because the
  apply pass filters candidates against a snapshot of applied ids taken before it starts,
  both copies passed the filter. A non-idempotent body (an INSERT, a backfill, an ALTER
  without IF NOT EXISTS) would be applied twice. Registration now deduplicates by
  migration id.
- **`HealthChangedEvent` was declared but never raised**, so anything subscribing to it
  waited forever. It is now published when the aggregate health state transitions — not on
  every poll — and a failing subscriber cannot turn a healthy library unhealthy.

### Fixed (SQL functions)

- **`SqlFn.Round(value, digits)` generated invalid SQL.** PostgreSQL's two-argument
  `round` accepts `numeric` only, so `round(double precision, integer)` does not exist.
  The value is now cast for the call and back for the result.
- **Date-part functions read the session time zone, not UTC.** `EXTRACT` over a
  `timestamptz` uses the server's `TimeZone` setting, so on a server set to `Europe/Paris`
  an instant stored as 15:09 UTC reported hour 16 — and around midnight the day, month and
  year shifted too. Since the library writes every `DateTime` as UTC, `Year`, `Month`,
  `Day`, `Hour`, `Minute`, `DayOfWeek` and `Date` now read back in UTC.
- `ConnectionManager.GetServerInfoAsync` still ran the MySQL query
  `SELECT VERSION(), @@version_comment, DATABASE(), @@hostname`, which PostgreSQL rejects
  outright. Replaced with `version()`, `current_setting`, `current_database()` and
  `inet_server_addr()`.

### Fixed (schema scoping)

- **The schema-state sentinel was keyed on the bare table name.** Two entities with the
  same table name in different schemas therefore shared one row: whichever synced last
  owned the CRC, and a later model change to the other was skipped by the fast path. The
  key is now `schema.table`. `SchemaStateStore` resolves an unqualified name against the
  default schema, so the public diagnostic API still accepts a bare table name.
- **Sync now creates the schema it needs.** An entity declaring
  `[Table(Schema = "...")]` failed on first run with `3F000: schema does not exist`, even
  though sync already creates tables, indexes, constraints and triggers. `CL.MSSQL` had
  always created its own; PostgreSQL now matches.
- **Restoring a table from backup did not clear its CRC sentinel**, so the next sync would
  skip a table that had just been rebuilt from possibly-different DDL.

### Changed

- **Rebuilt on the `CL.MySQL2` architecture.** The library's internals were replaced with a
  dialect-swapped port of `CL.MySQL2`, the same way `CL.MSSQL` was built, taking the source
  tree from 17 files to 45 and bringing the three database libraries onto one codebase shape.

### Added

- `RetentionWorker.RunOnceAsync()` — the retention pass was only reachable from a
  background loop that wakes once a day behind an initial delay, so there was no way for an
  operator to trigger a purge (or for a test to exercise one deterministically).

- Query cache with table-version invalidation, named smart-cache pools with background
  refresh, and a pluggable cache store / coordinator for multi-node deployments.
- Database-backed migrations: `IMigration`, `MigrationRunner`, `IMigrationContext`,
  version-ordered plans, and rollback. Migration history now lives in a table rather than a
  local JSON file, so instances of the same application no longer each keep their own copy
  and re-run everything.
- CRC-gated schema state tracking plus a `pg_advisory_lock`-based sync lock, so several
  instances starting at once no longer race on DDL.
- Joins, typed projections, grouping, cursor (keyset) pagination, `WhereIn`, `WhereNotIn`,
  `WhereExists` and `WhereNotExists`.
- `ON CONFLICT` upserts (`UpsertAsync`, `UpsertManyAsync`, `UpsertWithIncrementsAsync`),
  soft delete, a retention worker, and query observability events.
- `EntityMetadata<T>` with compiled property accessors and a compiled row materializer,
  replacing the previous per-row reflection -- the old mapper ran a linear property scan
  with a `GetCustomAttribute` call for every column of every row.
- PostgreSQL-native type support: `uuid`, `timestamptz`, `jsonb`, arrays, ranges, `inet`,
  `macaddr`, identity columns, and `INCLUDE` covering indexes.

### Security

- **Fixed SQL injection through unvalidated column names.** `GetByColumnAsync`,
  `GetPagedAsync(orderByColumn)` and the dictionary overload of `QueryBuilder.UpdateAsync`
  interpolated caller-supplied strings directly into SQL. All string-typed column APIs now
  resolve through an `EntityMetadata<T>` allow-list, and identifiers are rendered through
  `PostgreSqlDialect.Quote` and validated where they enter the metadata.
- **Fixed connection-string injection.** Connection strings were assembled by string
  concatenation, so a `;` in a password or database name could append arbitrary connection
  options. They are now built with `NpgsqlConnectionStringBuilder`.
- **`AllowDestructiveSync` is no longer a dead setting.** It was declared, surfaced in the
  configuration UI as a guard against `DROP` during schema sync, and never read anywhere in
  the library. Destructive DDL is now gated by `SyncMode` / `SchemaSyncLevel`, with
  `AllowDestructiveSync` honoured for backwards compatibility.
- LIKE metacharacters in user-supplied values are escaped, so a `%` in a search term no
  longer silently changes the result set.
- Backup filenames are sanitised rather than interpolated from schema and table names.

### Fixed

- **`ids.Contains(x.Id)` on a `List<T>` or `HashSet<T>` threw instead of emitting `IN`.**
  The expression visitor's first `Contains` case matched any single-argument instance call,
  so a collection membership test took the string `LIKE` branch and tried to emit the
  collection itself as a column. Arrays were unaffected because they bind to the static
  two-argument `Enumerable.Contains`, which had its own case. The `LIKE` branch is now
  restricted to a string receiver, and both membership shapes share one emitter.
- **Schema sync no longer rewrites every table on every startup.** The analyzer compared
  `information_schema.data_type` against the generated DDL with a lowercase string compare.
  Those vocabularies never match -- PostgreSQL reports `character varying`, `numeric`,
  `timestamp with time zone`; the generator emitted `VARCHAR(255)`, `NUMERIC(10,2)`,
  `TIMESTAMPTZ` -- so every string, decimal, timestamp, time and array column was issued an
  `ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE` on each sync, taking an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock and rewriting the
  table. Types are now canonicalised through an alias table before comparison.
- Unique columns produced two unique constraints: one inline in the column definition and
  one as a separate named constraint.
- DDL scripts were split on bare `;`, which broke any statement containing a semicolon in a
  default or comment, and each fragment ran on its own connection so a table and its indexes
  were not created atomically.
- `Contains()` over an empty collection emitted `IN ()`, a syntax error. It now emits a
  false literal.
- `ToPagedListAsync` returned the first group's row count instead of the number of groups
  when combined with `GroupBy`.
- `InsertManyAsync` issued one round trip per row and was not transactional, so a failure
  part-way through left earlier rows committed. Inserts are now batched and bounded by
  PostgreSQL's 65535-parameter statement limit.
- Bitwise `&` and `|` in a predicate were translated to logical `AND` / `OR`, silently
  corrupting integer bitmask comparisons.
- The retention worker used `DELETE ... LIMIT`, which PostgreSQL does not support; batches
  are now selected by `ctid` with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`.
- Cancellation tokens were not forwarded to connection acquisition, so opening a connection
  could not be cancelled.
- `ConnectionManager` held its configuration map in a non-concurrent `Dictionary` that could
  be written by `RegisterConfiguration` while another thread read it.
- `ExecuteWithConnectionAsync` disposed the connection twice.

### Verified against a live server

Every integration test runs against PostgreSQL 18.4 (156 tests, none skipped), covering
all 45 `DataType` members, every inferred CLR mapping, value round-trips, the full set of
`ALTER` operations, both sync modes, migrations, caching, retention and the observability
events. Three defects only execution could surface were fixed:

Every integration test now runs against PostgreSQL 18.4 (115 tests, none skipped). Two
defects that only execution could surface were fixed in the process:

- `SchemaSyncLock` issued `SET lock_timeout = @ms`. `SET` is parsed before parameters are
  bound, so the server saw `SET lock_timeout = $1` and raised `42601`. The advisory lock is
  taken at the start of every sync, so this broke schema synchronisation outright. Now uses
  `set_config()`, which takes the value as a bound argument.
- The catalog readers in `SchemaAnalyzer` and `BackupManager` read `a.attidentity` as a
  string. It is the internal `"char"` type, which Npgsql will not return as one, and this
  broke every `ALTER` path. Both now cast to `text` in SQL.
- A `daterange` column returns `NpgsqlRange<DateTime>`, so a property declared
  `NpgsqlRange<DateOnly>` failed with a message naming both sides as ``NpgsqlRange`1`` — a
  message that names neither type usefully. Range bounds are now converted element-wise,
  and conversion failures report full generic type names.

### Added (API)

- `GetRepository<T>(TransactionScope)` and `Query<T>(TransactionScope)`.
  `BeginTransactionAsync` returned a scope that neither accessor took, so callers had to
  construct `Repository<T>` by hand to do any work inside a transaction.

### Migration notes

This release is **not source-compatible**. Renames and behaviour changes:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `PostgreSQLConfig` | `DatabaseConfiguration` |
| `DatabaseConfig` | `PostgreSqlDatabaseConfig` |
| config section `mysql` (a port leftover) | `postgresql` |
| `SslMode` | `PostgreSqlSslMode` |
| default port `3306` | `5432` |
| `QueryRaw()` | `SqlQueryAsync<T>()` / `ExecuteSqlAsync()` |
| `Models/Configuration.cs` | `Configuration/DatabaseConfiguration.cs` |

- The `DataType` enum is now PostgreSQL's type set. `DataType.Unspecified` is the default
  and infers from the CLR property type; `Guid` infers `uuid` rather than `CHAR(36)`, and
  `DateTime` infers `timestamptz`.
- Upserts need a conflict target. `ON CONFLICT` arbitrates on one named unique key rather
  than MySQL's "any duplicate key". It is inferred when the entity has exactly one candidate
  and must otherwise be passed as `conflictTarget`.
- Non-nullable CLR value types now generate `NOT NULL` columns.
- Identifiers are emitted double-quoted and are therefore case-sensitive.

## 2026-09-12

### Changed

- Unified the version line with the CodeLogic framework on **4.8.x**. Every official
  library and the framework now share one `major.minor`, so a given `4.8.<patch>`
  means the same generation across all packages.
- `version.txt` moved from `4.6` to `4.8`. The patch component remains the CI run
  number, composed at pack time; `AssemblyVersion` stays pinned at `Major.Minor.0.0`
  (now `4.8.0.0`) so every patch in the line loads interchangeably.

## 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- Query-builder parameter re-keying could corrupt SQL when a predicate emitted
  11+ parameters (`@p1` substring-collided with `@p10`/`@p11`); parameters are
  now renamed longest-name-first.
- The expression translator wiped the entire WHERE buffer for a `null == x.Prop`
  comparison (it called `_sql.Clear()`), producing malformed SQL when combined
  with other clauses; null comparisons in both operand orders now translate to
  `IS [NOT] NULL` without discarding accumulated SQL.

### Documentation

- Full README rewrite to the unified house style: concise NuGet + MIT badges,
  one-line tagline, `Install` / `Quick start` / `Features` / `Configuration`
  (table + JSON) / `Documentation` / `Requirements` / `License`, with the API
  detail moved to the docs site (no full API dump in the README).
- Replaced the single `docs/libs/postgresql.md` guide with a three-page docs set
  mirroring CL.MySQL2's depth model: **Overview** (load, multi-database,
  repository CRUD, entry points, config, health, events), **Query Builder**
  (fluent methods, terminals, aggregates, bulk update/delete, raw SQL via
  `QueryRaw`/repository raw, transactions), and **Schema & Sync** (entity
  attributes, the `DataType` enum, table/set/namespace sync, `SyncResult`,
  schema backups, the migration tracker).
- The old `docs/libs/postgresql.md` is now a thin redirect to the new Overview.
- No API changes — documentation only.

## [4.5.2] — 2026-06-20

### Documentation

- Documented the full **query builder** surface: `OrderByDescending`, `Limit`/`Offset`
  (and `Take`/`Skip` aliases), `Join`, `Select`, `GroupBy`, `WithConnection`,
  `ToPagedListAsync`, `FirstOrDefaultAsync`, the `CountAsync`/`MaxAsync`/`MinAsync`/
  `SumAsync`/`AverageAsync` aggregates, and bulk `UpdateAsync`/`DeleteAsync`. Earlier
  docs listed only `Where`/`OrderBy`/`ToListAsync`.
- Documented raw SQL access via `QueryRaw()` (`QueryAsync`/`ExecuteAsync`).
- Documented the **repository** beyond basic CRUD: `InsertManyAsync`, `GetByColumnAsync`,
  `GetPagedAsync`, `FindAsync`, `IncrementAsync`/`DecrementAsync`, and
  `RawQueryAsync`/`RawExecuteAsync`.
- Documented the schema attributes `[Table]`, `[Column]`, `[ForeignKey]`,
  `[CompositeIndex]`, and `[Ignore]`, plus the `DataType` enum.
- Documented **table sync / migrations**: `SyncTablesAsync`, `SyncNamespaceAsync`,
  `SyncResult`, the `BackupManager` (schema backups + cleanup), and the
  `MigrationTracker` JSON history.
- Documented **transactions** via `BeginTransactionAsync` (auto-rollback on dispose).
- Documented previously-omitted configuration: `MaxIdleTime`, `AllowDestructiveSync`,
  multi-database `connectionId` selection, and runtime `RegisterDatabase`.

### Notes

- The 4.0.0 "repository CRUD only" note is superseded — the query builder
  (joins, aggregation, paging, bulk update/delete) is present and now documented.

## [4.5.0] — 2026-05-24

### Changed

- **Unified versioning.** All CodeLogic.Libs now share a single version line
  controlled by `version.txt` in the repo root. This is a version alignment
  release — no functional changes to this library.
## [4.0.4] — 2026-04-16

### Changed

- README + manifest refresh for the v4 baseline. No functional changes vs 4.0.3.
- `LibraryManifest.Version` now reads from assembly metadata.

## [4.0.2] — 2026-04-09

### Changed

- Annotated PostgreSQL configuration with `[ConfigField]` for the admin UI surface.
- Aligned with the v4 baseline across all libraries.

## [4.0.0] — 2026-04-09

Major rewrite. Republished as v4.0.0 to reset the version line under the
unified v4 baseline. Repository pattern + attribute-driven schema sync,
mirroring the CL.MySQL2 surface.

### Notes

- The MySQL2 4.0 query-builder rewrite (projection pushdown, SQL aggregation,
  smart-cache pools) has not been ported to CL.PostgreSQL yet — repository
  CRUD only.
- Earlier history is retained in the
  [git log](https://github.com/Media2A/CodeLogic.Libs/commits/main/CL.PostgreSQL).
