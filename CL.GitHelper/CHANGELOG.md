# CL.GitHelper — Changelog

All notable changes to **CodeLogic.GitHelper** are documented here. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- SSH is not supported by the bundled LibGit2Sharp transport; configuring an SSH
  key now logs a clear warning and cloning an SSH URL (`git@…` / `ssh://…`)
  fails fast with an explanatory message instead of silently doing nothing.
- `EnsureUpToDateAsync` now refuses to hard-reset (and discard) a dirty working
  tree unless called with `discardLocalChanges: true`, preventing accidental
  data loss.
- The repository cache now expires entries by idle time rather than absolute
  age, so a repository in active use is no longer disposed out from under a
  caller; batch concurrency is clamped to at least 1; `CommitOptions` gained a
  `CancellationToken`.

### Documentation

- Full house-style rewrite of the README and the `docs/libs/githelper.md` deep guide.
- Documented the repository workflow around `GetRepositoryAsync` and highlighted
  `EnsureUpToDateAsync` as the idempotent clone-or-update easy path.
- Documented the per-operation options models (`GitCloneOptions`, `GitFetchOptions`,
  `GitPullOptions`, `GitPushOptions`, `GitCommitOptions`) and the `MergeStrategy` enum.
- Documented the `GitResult<T>` / `GitDiagnostics` contract and the result-bearing models
  (`RepositoryInfo`, `CommitInfo`, `BranchInfo`, `RepositoryStatus`, `FileStatusEntry`).
- Documented manager batch operations (`FetchAllAsync`, `GetAllStatusAsync`), runtime
  registration, repository caching (`CacheStats` / `CacheEntryStats`), and the health check.
- Clarified authentication: HTTPS only, PAT-only auth sends `x-access-token`, and the SSH
  key fields are present in config but not currently wired.

## [4.5.2] — 2026-06-20

### Documentation

- Documented the full `GitRepository` workflow in the README: `CloneAsync`,
  `FetchAsync`, `PullAsync`, `PushAsync`, `ListBranchesAsync`, `CheckoutBranchAsync`,
  `CommitAsync` (with `FilesToStage`), and `GetCommitLogAsync`.
- Documented the `ResetHardAsync` and `EnsureUpToDateAsync` sync helpers with examples.
- Documented the `GitResult<T>` return contract (`IsSuccess` / `Value` / `ErrorMessage`
  / `Diagnostics`).
- Documented `GitManager` access via `GetManager()`, including `ExecuteOnAllAsync`,
  `HealthCheckAsync`, runtime `RegisterRepository` / `UnregisterRepositoryAsync`, and
  cache control (`GetCacheStats`, `ClearCacheAsync`).
- Clarified authentication: PAT-only auth sends `x-access-token`, and the SSH key
  configuration fields are reserved but not currently wired (use HTTPS URLs).

## [4.5.0] — 2026-05-24

### Changed

- **Unified versioning.** All CodeLogic.Libs now share a single version line
  controlled by `version.txt` in the repo root. This is a version alignment
  release — no functional changes to this library.
## [4.0.4] — 2026-04-16

### Changed

- README + manifest refresh for the v4 baseline. No functional changes vs 4.0.3.
- `LibraryManifest.Version` now reads from assembly metadata.

## [4.0.3] — 2026-04-15

### Added

- Wired credentials through to `Clone` / `Fetch` / `Pull` and added
  `ResetHard` + `EnsureUpToDate` helpers.

## [4.0.2] — 2026-04-09

### Changed

- Annotated GitHelper configuration with `[ConfigField]` for the admin UI surface.
- Aligned with the v4 baseline across all libraries.

## [4.0.0] — 2026-04-09

Major rewrite. Republished as v4.0.0 to reset the version line under the
unified v4 baseline. Thin libgit2sharp wrapper for programmatic clone /
pull / fetch / reset.

### Notes

- Earlier history is retained in the
  [git log](https://github.com/Media2A/CodeLogic.Libs/commits/main/CL.GitHelper).
